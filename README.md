# Daniel-Liu-s-Will
I don't plan on dying, but in the case of unexpected death, this is my will.

# Shares in Voithos Labs
I leave my shares to Finn Williams, the other co-founder of Voithos Labs. 

# Belongings
I leave all my belongings and properties (both materialistic and intellectual ones) to my immediate family. Do with them what you please, but donate my books to a library.

# To Those Who Care
Do not be sad, for I am only returning what I borrowed back to the universe.
